1. Implement a data comparison module.
Concatenate all char fields in source. 
Concat all char fields in target. 
Compare the hashes for this string, instead of doing a field by field comparison.

Comparison module must allow user to input how much of the data is to be compared. 
By default set this param to 100%.

2. Implement a logging module to log data that is not the same between source and target.

3. Fudge data to introduce failure conditions.
